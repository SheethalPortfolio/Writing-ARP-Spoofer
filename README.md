# üõ°Ô∏è ARP Spoofer using Scapy | CSCI369 Ethical Hacking Assignment (Q1)

This repository contains a Python-based ARP spoofing tool built as part of the **CSCI369 Ethical Hacking** module (SIM-UOW, S3 2025). The assignment focused on demonstrating a practical **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** attack using **Scapy** in a virtual lab setup involving Kali Linux and Metasploitable2 VMs.

---

## üìò Assignment Objective

> "Write a Python program that performs an ARP spoofing attack with a single command:  
> `sudo python3 arpspoof.py <Victim_IP> <Router_IP>`  
> The tool must use the `scapy` package (no subprocess or shell commands) and demonstrate a successful ARP spoof against a Metasploitable2 VM when executed from a Kali VM."

## üíª What This Script Does

This Python script performs an ARP spoofing attack using the Scapy library. When run from Kali Linux, it continuously sends fake ARP replies to both a victim machine (e.g., Metasploitable2) and the default gateway (router). The attacker (Kali) pretends to be the router to the victim, and vice versa. This causes both parties to unknowingly send their traffic to the attacker ‚Äî enabling man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. The script takes two IP arguments (victim and router), resolves their MAC addresses, and uses crafted ARP replies to poison their ARP tables. When the user presses CTRL+C, the program automatically sends legitimate ARP replies to restore the original network state. This technique demonstrates a fundamental Layer 2 attack in ethical hacking scenarios.

## üß™ Lab Setup

| VM              | Role      | Example IP   |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Kali Linux      | Attacker  | 10.0.2.15    |
| Metasploitable2 | Victim    | 10.0.2.4     |
| Router/Gateway  | Router IP | 10.0.2.1     |

---

## üîß How to Run

### üí° Prerequisites
- VirtualBox with **Kali Linux** and **Metasploitable2** VMs
- Both VMs on the **same network** (e.g., NAT or Host-Only)
- Install Scapy on Kali:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3-scapy
  ```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution Command

```bash
sudo python3 arpspoof.py <Victim_IP> <Router_IP>
```

Example:
```bash
sudo python3 arpspoof.py 10.0.2.4 10.0.2.1
```

---

## üîç How to Verify the ARP Spoofing Attack

1. **Start the script from Kali**:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 arpspoof.py 10.0.2.4 10.0.2.1
   ```

2. **Switch to Meta2** and run:
   ```bash
   arp -a
   ```

3. Check the entry for the **router IP (e.g. 10.0.2.1)** ‚Äî it should now point to the **IP address of Kali**, meaning:
   - Meta2 believes the router's IP is located at Kali's MAC

4. To confirm this from Kali, run:
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   - Get Kali‚Äôs IP (e.g. `10.0.2.15`)
   - If Meta2‚Äôs ARP table shows `10.0.2.1` ‚Üí mapped to Kali‚Äôs MAC, the spoof worked ‚úÖ

5. Press `CTRL+C` in Kali to stop the script ‚Äî it restores the network.

6. Run `arp -a` again in Meta2 ‚Äî now the router IP should point back to its original MAC.

---

## üìå How Did I Find the IPs?

### Victim IP (Meta2):
```bash
ifconfig
```

### Router IP (Default Gateway):
```bash
netstat -rn
```

Look for:
```
Destination   Gateway
0.0.0.0       10.0.2.1
```

## üß† Optional Learning Tools

- Ping test:
  ```bash
  ping 10.0.2.1  # From Meta2
  ping 10.0.2.4  # From Kali
  ```
